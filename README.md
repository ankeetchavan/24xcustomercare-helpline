# Service Center Template

This is a clean, responsive template that mirrors the layout shown in your screenshot, with placeholders for assets and your phone number pre-wired (18003091619).

## Quick Start

Just open `index.html` in your browser.

## Customize

- Replace placeholder images in `assets/images/` with your real assets (keep file names or update `index.html`).
- Update business details in the footer of `index.html` (GST, company, email, address).
- If you need WhatsApp, change the call button `href` to `https://wa.me/<number>?text=...`.

## Notes on Branding and Copyright

This template avoids copying proprietary branding or design elements. If you plan to use third-party brand names or logos, ensure you have the appropriate rights and include a clear disclaimer stating you are an independent provider.

## Optional

- Form currently confirms and dials support, or opens an email draft. Hook it to your backend by pointing the form `action` to your endpoint.
- Colors are controlled via CSS variables in `styles.css`.
